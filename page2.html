                    Raymond Reddington is a highly intelligent, highly driven individual with developed sociopathic tendencies. For all intents and purposes, this was caused by a PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) as there are no signs that he was born this way. Sly, manipulative, and charming. Red is always three steps ahead of everyone else, and is determined to keep himself a mystery. As he puts it, “I’m a criminal. Criminals are notorious liars. Everything about me is a lie.” That’s probably true, actually, but who knows for sure. He dislikes rude people, which is something that Agent Ressler pointed out after Red let a notorious drug dealer get away with false identification. Ressler mentioned that Red wouldn’t let the drug dealer get away because he was rude and Red doesn’t like rude people. Red responded with, “He is on my jet.”
                    Red does not believe he’s a psychopath. In his eyes, what he’s done in the criminal world is all an effect of the murder of his family. He turned his back on his country and his career because somehow they were responsible for the elimination of his family. He functions with his own set of morals, that most of society probably wouldn’t agree with.

                    Born in Moscow, Russia (Soviet Union) as Masha Rostova, Elizabeth Keen, at the age of 4, was involved in a traumatic incident in which she shot and killed her father, the real Raymond Reddington, to stop him from attacking her mother, Katarina Rostova, then she moved to Nebraska and was raised by Sam Scott
                    She had been with the FBI for 6 years and was head of the mobile emergency psych unit in New York. In “Pilot”, she was asked to profile herself by Harold Cooper and revealed that her subordinates in New York called her “sir” and thought her to be a “bitch”. She is also revealed to have a degree in forensic psychology and graduated from Quantico a month before the series begins. Raymond Reddington reveals that she had highlights before the start of the series, and may have resided temporarily in Baltimore.
                    At about the same time she joined the FBI, she met Tom Keen and later married him, taking his surname.
                    It is later revealed in “Sutton Ross” that the real Raymond Reddington is her father, not the imposter who took his place 30 years ago and is currently known as Red. In “Rassvet”, Liz learns from her grandfather, who was located with Donald Ressler's help, that the man she shot the night of the fire was in fact the real Raymond Reddington while her mother's lover Ilya Koslov took on Reddington's identity to protect Katarina. However, Katarina's fate continues to remain unknown as Liz's grandfather hasn't heard from her in 28 years.

                    Donald Ressler is a highly devoted and dedicated individual who never lets personal emotions become a detriment and pursues his objectives with an unyielding desire to always accomplish his mission while acknowledging that not every person can be saved. He hates giving way to rampant criminalism and refuses to give in to corruption and will continue to fight crime with a determined mindset while going to extreme lengths to achieve what he deems is the most “just” outcome.
                    However, despite his utter hatred for crime; he makes an exception to Raymond Reddington mostly because of his established connection with Reddington and recognition of his importance and desire to effectively prevent crime or terrorists winning, preventing mass murders, massacres, and blacklisters from winning. He cares deeply about his teammates and will go far to prevent them from getting hurt, falesly accused, or killed in the midst of battle or an ambush. He his fiercely dedicated to his job and ruthlessly pursues individuals to an obsessive extent, occasionally becoming blind to the obvious that occasionally leads to his detriment.
